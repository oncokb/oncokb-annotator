jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  main:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: main
      uses: cclauss/GitHub-Action-for-pytest@0.5.0
